## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to evoke a sense of calm and focus.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), almost white, for a clean, distraction-free interface.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFB347) to highlight important elements and calls to action without being too distracting.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, neutral and easily readable design. Its clean lines and excellent legibility make it ideal for long test sessions.
- Simple, clear icons for navigation and status indicators, focusing on usability.
- Clean, single-column layout for questions and options to minimize distraction. Use clear section headings and progress indicators.
- Subtle transitions between pages and sections. Progress bar updates should be smooth and non-disruptive.
